            <p>Most of the energy used today are obtained from the fossil fuels. It is predicted that we will run out of fossil fuels in this century. Oil can last up to 50 years, natural gas up to 53 years, and coal up to 114 years.
            Thus switching to renewable source energy is the need of the moment.
            Nowadays people use smart devices like Wi-Fi lights and fans, but when smart bulbs are compared to regular LED bulbs,<br>
            the cost outweighs the reason to switch to a smart bulb. Moreover individual smart device consumes extra power (even
            when turned off) to communicate with other devices on the network.
            <br><br>
            Thus we need to make an appealing product which will make us switch.</p>

                    <p>
                    • Unlike current Smart Devices which are expensive and requires complex setups and many different apps our solution can
                    turn any non-smart appliance into a smart one hence saving our customers the expense when replacing an electric
                    appliance.
                    <br><br>
                    • The Solar Circuit Hub comes with the reliability of controlling any non-smart appliance connected to the mains
                    directly from your smartphone or your smart speakers.
                    <br><br>
                    • Our product is coupled with Solar Panels uses solar energy alongside electricity from the mains to run the appliances
                    of your place, making our customer happy with their savings and also the future generations for a cleaner and greener
                    Earth.
